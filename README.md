# Trocador-de-cores

A responsive webpage. When the button "Trocar cor" is clicked, the backgrond color and the text displaying its HEX code should change accordingly.

NOTE: It only changes from dark gray to white for now. It should change from dark gray to white, from white to light gray, or from light gray to dark gray.
The text displaying the HEX is still unresponsive.

PERSONAL NOTE: It only changes from dark gray to white for now. It should change 
from dark gray to white, from white to light gray, or from light gray to dark gray. 
And the text displaying the HEX is still unresponsive. I tried many different things 
but didn't manage to make it work as it should on time. I'm still trying to figure out 
why and how to make the background color and text change as they're supposed to.
